1. Turn the code that we wrote for insertionSort into an insertionSort function that works for any
sized array.

2. Write a program that takes in 50 values and prints out the highest, the lowest, the average and
then all 50 input values, one per line.

3. Write a program that detects if a list is sorted or not, and if it is not sorted, sort it.

4. Write a small tic-tac-toe program that allows two players to play tic-tac-toe competitively. Your
program should check to see if either player has won, or if the board is filled completely (with
the game ending in a tie). Bonus: can you make your program detect if the game cannot be won
by either side before the entire grid is filled?

5.Make your tic-tac-toe game into a version of connect-4 that allow boards bigger than 3 by 3 but
requires 4-in-a-row to win.
